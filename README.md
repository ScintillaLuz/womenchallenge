I am a strong supporter of the idea that **diversity doesn't come, in this society, as the norm**. Diversity can be achieved, actively pushing boundaries and keeping an eye on the balance in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation, class. This is, in my opinion, valid in any given situation, or activity.

Thinking about **reading**, and looking at my personal experience I can easily tell that my exposure to women writers was undoubtedly low, and without any excuse lower than acceptable. That's why is important to make the effort to **read more books written by women**, and the reason why this year I subscribed to the [Women Challenge](http://www.peekabook.it/2014/12/2015-women-challenge.html) promoted by Valentina. I made my goal to read over 20 books, fiction and non-fiction, by women writers, writing them a simple review to help others to choose the best reads. It would be great if we could **expand this list** to have a small library of suggestions, maybe giving publicity to some forgotten writers who deserve attention.
